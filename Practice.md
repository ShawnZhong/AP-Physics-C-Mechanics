Question 6
==========

  <img src="./media/image336.png" alt="If the resultant of all the external forces acting on a system of particles is zero, then from an inertial frame, one can surely say that: 1: Linear momentum of the system does not change in time. 2: Kinetic energy of the system does not change in time. 3: Angular momentum of the system does not change in time. 4: Potential energy of the system does not change in time. My attempt ( I will for moment assume that my system of particle might be a rod) I can surely see that since net external force has a resultant 0 it easily implies that Linear momentum remain conserved. (A) The net external forces maybe 0 butthenetto uema orma not be 0 hence the bod ma start to rotate about some axis and gam rotation netlc energy, ence answer IS Incorrect.

The center of mass of the person- raft system is a distance d from the center of the raft. The person then walks to the other end of the raft. If friction between the raft and the water is negligible, how far does the raft move relative to the water? "/>

-   After the person has walked to the other end, the situation must be the mirror image of this one; the center of mass will be shifted to a distance d to the left of the center of the raft.

-   But the center of mass cannot move as the person walks on the boat.

-   Therefore, the boat must have moved a distance 2d to the right.

Question 24
===========

  <img src="./media/image360.png" alt="A solid cylinder of mass nt and radius R has a string wound around it. A person holding the string pulls it vertically upward, as shown above, such that the cylinder is suspended in midair for a brief time interval At and its center of mass does not move. The tension in the string is T, and the rotational 2 inertia of the cylinder about its axis is —mR "/>

  <img src="./media/image361.png" alt="24. The linear acceleration of the person&#39;s hand during the time interval At is (E) zero T -mg 2 (C) (D) "/>

  <img src="./media/image362.png" alt="There is an associated, famous problem about dropping a spool (with the cord held by a motionless hand). In that case, you write Newton&#39;s Second Law for the forces and for the torques, where one associates a with acm Fnet = mg - T = ma T = TR = la = I(a/R) . Then T = la/R2 and mg ma = mg — la/R2 a = m + (1/R2) The problem here is, of course, that the center of mass acceleration is zero. In fact you have to think a little more carefully. The typical relationship for rolling without slipping, a = OR, still holds, but now it is the tangential acceleration of the rim, which is equal to the upward acceleration of the cord (and the hand.) Generally in rolling without slipping (on a horizontal surface, for example), the rim&#39;s acceleration is the same as the center of mass&#39;s; that isn&#39;t true here. Here, the center of mass doesn&#39;t move at all during the time interval At. But we can still say, with a the acceleration of the rim (equal to the acceleration of the hand), T = = la = I(a/R) From the previous problem, we know T = mg. Then rngR = I(a/R) = x (a/R) = 2rnaR = 29. Unsurprisingly, 90% of those who Cancel mR on both sides, multiply both sides by 2 and obtain a took the test got this one wrong. "/>

Question 25
===========

  <img src="./media/image363.png" alt="A figure skater goes into a spin with arms fully extended. Which of the following describes the changes in the rotational kinetic energy and angular momentum of the skater as the skater&#39;s arms are brought toward the body? "/>

  <img src="./media/image364.png" alt="The angular momentum cannot change, because there are no external torques. On the other hand, we have the useful formulas and K = 2m 21 As the skater&#39;s arms come in, I, which depends on the square of the average distance of mass from the axis, is getting smaller. Since the kinetic energy depends directly on the square of the angular momentum and inversely on the moment of inertia, and I here decreases, it follows K increases. Also, work has to be done to draw the arms in; this work goes into increased kinetic energy. "/>

Question 32
===========

(In these diagrams, the triangle is shown in its original position.) "/>

Partial credit was awarded for less complete descriptions. The following were common examples. Other examples, though rarely cited, could receive partial or full credit. 1 Using photogates Place the photogates near x = 2 m and a small distance apart (such as a glider length). Measure the distance between the photogates. Measure the time the glider takes to travel between the photogates. Obtain the speed from distance/time. time to travel 2 m was used. 2. Using a spring The spring constant k of the spring must be known, or if not, then measured. Set up the spring at x = 2 m so that it is compressed when struck by the glider. Measure the distance of maximum compression Xm. The velocity can then be determined from the equation = 3. Treating the glider as a projectile Adjust the starting point so that x = 2 m is at end of the track. Thus the glider leaves the track at this point and becomes a projectile. The height of the track determines the time interval t that the glider is in the air. The horizontal distance x from the end of the track to the point where the glider hits the ground is measured and then the velocity is computed from x/t. "/>

Such an answer logically concludes, at a minimum, that the linear speed or velocity at the bottom of the ramp is greater for the disk because the rotational inertia of the disk is less. It is not necessary to state that the time of fall is the same. One point was awarded for a minimal or partially correct answer. No justification points were awarded if the space next to &quot;Greater than &quot; was not checked. Examples of 2-point answers: A disk will have smaller rotational inertia and will therefore have velocity. This will lead to a greater translational velocity, and a greater distance x. The rotational inertia is less thanüfiÖfi6ÖTüGfiüFéäiFacceleration and more final speed at the end of the table. The acceleration when I = MR2/2 is (2/3) g sing, so the disk will be moving faster at the bottom of the ramp and will travel farther. Examples of I-point answers: A disk has a larger rotational inertia, so it will have a greater kinetic energy and will therefore land farther from the ramp. The moment of inertia for the disk is smaller, thus its rotational velocity is bigger, causing it to go further. Less energy will be used to spin the disk than the hoop, and I of the disk is less than I of the hoop. "/>

The spring is attached to the left end of the track, as shown in the figure above, and produces a nonlinear restoring force of magnitude FS = As2 + Bs, where s is the distance the spring is compressed, in meters. A measuring tape, marked in centimeters, is attached to the side of the track. The student places five photogates on the track at the locations shown. "/>

  <img src="./media/image462.png" alt="2 points For stating that the measured initial speed of the cart is greater than the predicted value For correctly identifymg a source of error regarding the initial speed of the cart Examples: The student com ressed the s rin more than was determined. This would lead to more potential energy in the spring and greater kinetic energy for the cart. The cart would therefore move faster than predicted. The table is not level, sloping downward would result in a greater measured speed. The constants A and B for the sorina are not accurate. The true values are larger than what is given. This would lead to smaller predicted potential energy of the spring and a smaller predicted value for the kinetic energy of the cart. Therefore, the cart would move faster than predicted ii. 2 points For correctly identifying the trend For a correct physical explanation for the cart slowing down Examples: Friction in the axles and air resistance against the cart are slowing it down. theaaGk.is.AQ.LP%ie.Gfly-Iey.el and the cart is going uphill.
