Mass-Energy Equivalence
=======================

-   In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein formalized a relationship between mass and energy

-   The mass of an object, a key characteristic of matter, is really a measure of its energy

-   The source of all energy on Earth is the conversion of mass into energy
