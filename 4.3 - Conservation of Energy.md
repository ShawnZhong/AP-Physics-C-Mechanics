Non-Conservative Forces
=======================

-   Non-conservative forces change the total mechanical energy of a system, but not the total energy of a system

-   Work done by a non-conservative force is typically converted to internal (thermal) energy

  <img src="./media/image100.png" alt="Photogate Spring Glider Air Track Mech. 3. The apparatus above is used to study conservation of mechanical energy. A spring of force constant 40 N/m is held horizontal over a horizontal air track, with one end attached to the air track A light string is attached to the other end of the spring and connects it to a glider of mass m . The glider is pulled to stretch the spring an amount x from equilibrium and then released. Before reaching the photogate, the glider attains its maximum speed and the string becomes slack. The photogate measures the time t that it takes the small block on top of the glider to pass through.

=============================

  <img src="./media/image104.png" alt="Mech. 1. Students are to conduct an experiment to investigate the relationship between the terminal speed of a stack of falling paper coffee filters and its mass. Their procedure involves stacking a number of coffee filters, like the one shown in the figure above, and dropping the stack from rest. The students change the number of filters in the stack to vary the mass m while keeping the shape of the stack the same. As a stack of coffee filters falls, there is an air resistance (drag) force acting on the filters. (a) The students suspect that the drag force FL) is proportional to the square of the speed : FL) = c02 , where C is a constant. Using this relationship, derive an expression relating the terminal speed VT to the mass m. The students conduct the experiment and obtain the following data. -3 Mass of the stack of filters, m (kg) 1.12 x 10 Terminal speed, VT (m/s ) (b) 0.51 2.04 x 10 3 0.62 —3 2.96 x 10 0.82 —3 4.18 x 10 0.92 -3 5.10 x 10 1.06 (i) Assuming the functional relationship for the drag force above, use the grid below to plot a linear graph as a function of m to verify the relationship.
