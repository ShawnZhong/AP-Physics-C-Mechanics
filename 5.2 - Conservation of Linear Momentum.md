Collisions and Explosions
=========================

-   In the case of a collision or explosion, if you add up the individual momentum vectors of all the objects before the event, you'll find that they are equal to the sum of momentum vectors of the objects after the event

-   Written mathematically, the law of conservation of linear momentum states

Types of Collisions
===================

Total momentum and total energy of the system are conserved. Kinetic energy is conserved. Kinetic energy is NOT conserved. "/>

-   Elastic collision

    -   Kinetic energy is conserved

-   Inelastic collision

    -   Kinetic energy is not conserved
