The spring is attached to the left end of the track, as shown in the figure above, and produces a nonlinear restoring force of magnitude FS = As2 + Bs, where s is the distance the spring is compressed, in meters. A measuring tape, marked in centimeters, is attached to the side of the track. The student places five photogates on the track at the locations shown. "/>

  <img src="./media/image461.png" alt="(d) i. Compare the speed of the cart measured by photogate 1 to the predicted value of the speed of the cart just after it loses contact with the spring. List a physical source of error that could account for the difference. ii. From the measured speed values of the cart as it rolls down the track, give a physical explanation for any trend you observe. "/>

  <img src="./media/image462.png" alt="2 points For stating that the measured initial speed of the cart is greater than the predicted value For correctly identifymg a source of error regarding the initial speed of the cart Examples: The student com ressed the s rin more than was determined. This would lead to more potential energy in the spring and greater kinetic energy for the cart. The cart would therefore move faster than predicted. The table is not level, sloping downward would result in a greater measured speed. The constants A and B for the sorina are not accurate. The true values are larger than what is given. This would lead to smaller predicted potential energy of the spring and a smaller predicted value for the kinetic energy of the cart. Therefore, the cart would move faster than predicted ii. 2 points For correctly identifying the trend For a correct physical explanation for the cart slowing down Examples: Friction in the axles and air resistance against the cart are slowing it down. theaaGk.is.AQ.LP%ie.Gfly-Iey.el and the cart is going uphill. This is slowing down the cart. "/>
