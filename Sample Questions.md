Question 6
==========

  <img src="./media/image336.png" alt="If the resultant of all the external forces acting on a system of particles is zero, then from an inertial frame, one can surely say that: 1: Linear momentum of the system does not change in time. 2: Kinetic energy of the system does not change in time. 3: Angular momentum of the system does not change in time. 4: Potential energy of the system does not change in time. My attempt ( I will for moment assume that my system of particle might be a rod) I can surely see that since net external force has a resultant 0 it easily implies that Linear momentum remain conserved. (A) The net external forces maybe 0 butthenetto uema orma not be 0 hence the bod ma start to rotate about some axis and gam rotation netlc energy, ence answer IS Incorrect. Also, Following from above net torque acting on system may not be zero Angular momentum is not conserved. (C) is incorrect. "/>
