Conservation of Angular Momentum
================================

-   Spin angular momentum, the product of an object's moment of inertia and its angular velocity about the center of mass, is conserved in a closed system with no external net toques applied

=============================

-   An ice skater spins with a specific angular velocity. She brings her arms and legs closer to her body, reducing her moment of inertia to half its original value. What happens to her angular velocity? What happens to her rotational kinetic energy?

  <img src="./media/image267.png" alt="Before Collision After Collision TOP VIEWS Mech. 3. A system consists of a ball of mass M2 and a uniform rod of mass Ml and length d. The rod is attached to a horizontal frictionless table by a pivot at point P and initially rotates at an angular speed , as shown above left. The rotational inertia of the rod about point P is —Mld2. The rod strikes the ball, which is initially at rest. As a result of this collision, the rod is stopped and the ball moves in the direction shown above right.

Again assuming the collision is elastic, for what value of x will the rod stop moving after hitting the ball? "/>
