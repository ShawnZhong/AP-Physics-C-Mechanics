Matter
======

-   Matter - anything that has mass and takes up space

-   Mass - the amount of "stuff" making up an object

    -   Stars

    -   Electrons

    -   Neil Diamond

-   Inertial Mass

    -   How hard it is to accelerate an object

-   Gravitational Mass

    -   How large a gravitational force an object experiences

Energy
======

-   Energy - The ability or capacity to do work

-   Work - the process of moving an object

Mass-Energy Equivalence
=======================

-   In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein formalized a relationship between mass and energy

-   The mass of an object, a key characteristic of matter, is really a measure of its energy

-   The source of all energy on Earth is the conversion of mass into energy

Cross Product
=============

-   Cross (vector) product of two vectors gives you a vector perpendicular to both whose magnitude is equal to the area of a parallelogram defined by the two initial vectors

Position / Displacement
=======================

-   An object's position is its location at a given point in time

-   <img src="./media/image10.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image010.png" width="694" height="52" />

-   Position and displacement are both vectors

-   <img src="./media/image12.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image012.png" width="626" height="26" />

Average Speed
=============

-   Average speed is the distance traveled divided by the time interval

-   <img src="./media/image13.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image013.png" width="100" height="32" />

-   Average speed is a scalar, and is measured in meters/second

Average Velocity
================

-   Velocity is the rate at which position changes.

-   Average velocity is the displacement during a time interval divided by the time interval

-   <img src="./media/image14.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image014.png" width="190" height="40" />

-   Average velocity is a vector, and is also measured in meter/second

Acceleration
============

-   Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes

-   <img src="./media/image15.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image015.png" width="108" height="34" />

Instantaneous Velocity
======================

-   Average velocity observed over an infinitely small time interval provides instantons velocity

-   Instantaneous velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time

Special Case: Constant Acceleration
===================================

-   For cases of constant acceleration, we can derive a set of "kinematic equations" that will allow us to solve for unknown quantities

> <img src="./media/image21.png" alt="— V 02 -l- 2ClAľ V )t -at 2 Ax — vt — no Ax no v no t no a no v " width="658" height="477" />

Deriving the Kinematic Equations
================================

> <img src="./media/image22.png" alt="2 " width="676" height="418" />

Free Fall
=========

-   When the only force acting on an object is the force of gravity, we refer to object's motion as free fall

-   This includes objects that have a non-zero initial velocity

Air Resistance
==============

-   If we drop a ball and a sheet of paper, it is obvious they don't fall at the same rate

-   If we could remove all the air from the room, however, we would find that they fall at the same rate

-   We will analyze the motion of objects by neglecting air resistance (a form of friction) for the time being

Acceleration Due to Gravity
===========================

-   Near the surface of Earth, objects accelerate downward at a rate of 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>

-   We call this acceleration the acceleration due to gravity (g)

-   More accurately, g is referred to as the gravitational field strength

-   As you move further away from Earth, g decreases

 

 

2.3 - Projectile Motion

9:50 AM

 

What Is a Projectile
====================

-   A projectile is an object that is in acted upon only by gravity

-   In reality, air resistance plays a role

-   Typically, projectiles are objects launched at an angle

Path of a Projectile
====================

-   Projectiles launched at an angle move in parabolic arcs

> <img src="./media/image23.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image023.png" width="645" height="319" />

Independence of Motion
======================

-   Projectiles launched at an angle have motion in two dimensions

    -   Vertical - like free fall

    -   Horizontal - 0 acceleration

-   Vertical motion and horizontal motion can be treated separately!

Angled Projectiles
==================

-   For objects launched at an angle, you must first break up the object's initial velocity into x and y components of initial velocity

-   Then, use these components of initial velocity in your horizontal and vertical motion tables

-   An object will travel the maximum horizontal distance with a launch angle of 45°

> <img src="./media/image24.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image024.png" width="659" height="164" />

Graphing Projectile Motion
==========================

-   Track vector components as a function of time

-   Solve for time in the horizontal, and use that to eliminate time in the vertical equation

> <img src="./media/image25.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image025.png" width="659" height="267" />

Radians and Degrees
===================

-   In degrees, once around a circle is 360°

-   In radians, once around a circle is 2π

-   A radian measures a distance around an arc equal to the length of the arc's radius

-   <img src="./media/image26.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image026.png" width="152" height="18" />

Centripetal Acceleration
========================

<img src="./media/image44.png" alt="Express position vector in terms of unit vectors. Fte)z r$in a —Jr sin " width="602" height="421" />

Reference Frames
================

-   A reference frame describes the motion of an observer

    -   Most common reference frame is Earth

-   Laws of physics we study in this course assume we're in an inertial, non-accelerating reference frame

-   There is no way to distinguish between motion at rest and motion at a constant velocity in an inertial reference frame

Calculating Relative Velocities
===============================

-   Consider two objects, A and B.

-   Calculating the velocity of A with respect of reference frame B (and vice versa) is straightforward

-   Example:

    -   Speed of car with respect to the ground

    -   Walking on a train, speed of a person with respect to the train

3.1 - Newton's First Law & Free Body Diagrams

Monday, March 13, 2017

10:15 AM

 

Newton's First Law of Motion
============================

-   An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion, at constant velocity and in a straight line, un line acted upon by a net force

-   An object will continue in its current state of motion unless an unbalanced force acts upon it

-   An object at rest will remain at rest unless an unbalanced force acts upon them

-   Also known as the law of inertia

Force 
======

-   A force is a push or pull on an object

-   Unites of force are newtons (N)

-   <img src="./media/image47.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image047.png" width="166" height="38" />

<td>Gravity<br />
Electrical Force<br />
Magnetic Force</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Net Force 
==========

-   A net force is the vector sum of all the forces acting on an object

-   If all forces are balanced, there is no net force. This situation is known as translational equilibrium

-   An unbalanced force is a net force

Equilibrium
===========

-   Static Equilibrium

    -   Net force on an object is 0

    -   Net torque on an object is 0

    -   Object is at rest

-   Mechanical Equilibrium

    -   Net force on an object is 0

    -   Net torque on an object is 0

-   Translational Equilibrium

    -   Net force on an object is 0

Inertia
=======

-   Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in velocity

-   Mass actually has two aspects

    -   Inertial mass is how hard it is to change an object's velocity

    -   Gravitational mass is how strongly a gravitational field affects a mass

-   For the purposes of basic introductory physics, mass and inertia are synonymous

Free Body Diagrams
==================

-   Tools used to analyze physical situations

-   Show all the force acting on a single object

-   Object itself drawn as a dot or rectangle

3.2 - Newton's Second & Third Laws of Motion

Monday, March 13, 2017

10:53 AM

 

Newton's Second Law of Motion
=============================

-   The acceleration of an object is in the direction of and directly proportional to the net force applied, and inversely proportional to the object's mass

-   Valid only in inertial reference frames.

-   <img src="./media/image49.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image049.png" width="180" height="44" />

Mass vs. Weight
===============

-   Mass is the amount of "stuff" something is made up of.

-   It remains constant

-   Weight (mg) is the force of gravity on an object

    -   Weight varies with gravitational field strength (g)

Newton's Third Law of Motion
============================

-   All forces come in pairs. If Object 1 exerts a force on Object 2, then the Object 2 must exert a force back on Object 1, which is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction

-   <img src="./media/image50.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image050.png" width="170" height="22" />

Retarding Forces
================

-   Sometimes the frictional force is a function of an object's velocity (such as air resistance)

-   These forces are called drag, or retarding, forces.

9:55 PM

 

What is Work?
=============

-   Work is the process of moving an object by applying a force

-   The object must move for work to be done

-   The force must cause the movement

-   Work is a scalar quantity

-   Units are Joules

Work in One Dimension
=====================

-   Only the force in the direction of the displacement contributes to the work done

> <img src="./media/image76.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image076.png" width="565" height="222" />

Non-Constant Forces
===================

-   Work done is the area under the force vs. displacement graph

> <img src="./media/image77.png" alt="Rk)4 " width="558" height="334" />

Hooke's Law
===========

-   The more you stretch or compress a string, the greater the force of the spring

-   The spring's force is opposite the direction of its displacement from equilibrium

-   Model this as a linear relationship, where the force applied by the spring is equal to a constant (the spring constant) multiplied by the spring's displacement from its equilibrium (rest) position

-   <img src="./media/image78.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image078.png" width="122" height="18" />

-   Slope of the graph gives you the spring constant, k (in N/m)

> <img src="./media/image79.png" alt="Force (N) " width="539" height="359" />

Work Done in Compressing a Spring
=================================

-   A spring obeys Hooke's Law. How much work is done in compressing the spring from equilibrium to some point x?

Center of Mass
==============

-   Real objects are more complex than theoretical particles

-   Treat entire object as if its entire mass were contained at a single point known as the object's center of mass (CM)

-   Center of mass is the weighted average of the location of mass in an object

Find CM by Inspection
=====================

-   For uniform density objects, CM is the geometric center

-   For objects with multiple parts, find CM of each part and treat as a point

-   For irregular objects, suspend object from two or more points and drop a plumb line. The line intersects at the center of mass

7.2 - Moment of Inertia

Wednesday, March 15, 2017

8:21 PM

 

Types of Inertia
================

-   Inertial mass / translational inertia (M) is an object's ability to resist a linear acceleration

-   Moment of Inertia / rotational inertia (I) is an object's resistance to a rational acceleration

-   Objects that have most of their mass near their axis of rotation have smaller rotational inertias than objects with more mass farther from their axis of rotation

7.3 - Torque

Thursday, March 16, 2017

11:31 PM

 

Torque (τ)
==========

-   Torque is a force that causes an object to turn

-   Torque must be perpendicular to the displacement to cause a rotation

-   The further away the force is applied from the point of rotation, the more leverage you obtain, so this distance is known as the lever arm (r)

> <img src="./media/image214.png" alt="- Line of Action " width="523" height="246" />

-   <img src="./media/image215.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image215.png" width="120" height="22" />

-   <img src="./media/image216.png" alt="C:\25225E85\B09A51C6-0574-4A0C-A2C1-496768C10C63_files\image216.png" width="148" height="18" />

Direction of the Torque Vector
==============================

-   The direction of the torque vector is perpendicular to both the position vector and the force vector

-   You can find the direction using the right-hand rule. Point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the line of action, and bend you fingers in the direction of the force

-   You thumb then points in the direction of your torque

-   Note that positive torques cause counter-clockwise rotation, and negative torques cause clockwise rotation

Equilibrium
===========

-   Static Equilibrium implies that the net force and the net torque are zero, and the system is at rest

-   Dynamic Equilibrium implies that the net force and the net torque are zero, and the system is moving at constant translational and rotational velocity

In that case, you write Newton&#39;s Second Law for the forces and for the torques, where one associates a with acm Fnet = mg - T = ma T = TR = la = I(a/R) . Then T = la/R2 and mg ma = mg — la/R2 a = m + (1/R2) The problem here is, of course, that the center of mass acceleration is zero. In fact you have to think a little more carefully. The typical relationship for rolling without slipping, a = OR, still holds, but now it is the tangential acceleration of the rim, which is equal to the upward acceleration of the cord (and the hand.) Generally in rolling without slipping (on a horizontal surface, for example), the rim&#39;s acceleration is the same as the center of mass&#39;s; that isn&#39;t true here. Here, the center of mass doesn&#39;t move at all during the time interval At. But we can still say, with a the acceleration of the rim (equal to the acceleration of the hand), T = = la = I(a/R) From the previous problem, we know T = mg. Then rngR = I(a/R) = x (a/R) = 2rnaR = 29. Unsurprisingly, 90% of those who Cancel mR on both sides, multiply both sides by 2 and obtain a took the test got this one wrong.

Since the kinetic energy depends directly on the square of the angular momentum and inversely on the moment of inertia, and I here decreases, it follows K increases.

Measure the distance between the photogates. Measure the time the glider takes to travel between the photogates. Obtain the speed from distance/time. time to travel 2 m was used. 2. Using a spring The spring constant k of the spring must be known, or if not, then measured. Set up the spring at x = 2 m so that it is compressed when struck by the glider. Measure the distance of maximum compression Xm. The velocity can then be determined from the equation = 3. Treating the glider as a projectile Adjust the starting point so that x = 2 m is at end of the track. Thus the glider leaves the track at this point and becomes a projectile. The height of the track determines the time interval t that the glider is in the air. The horizontal distance x from the end of the track to the point where the glider hits the ground is measured and then the velocity is computed from x/t. " width="480" height="434" />

It is not necessary to state that the time of fall is the same. One point was awarded for a minimal or partially correct answer. No justification points were awarded if the space next to &quot;Greater than &quot; was not checked. Examples of 2-point answers: A disk will have smaller rotational inertia and will therefore have velocity. This will lead to a greater translational velocity, and a greater distance x. The rotational inertia is less thanüfiÖfi6ÖTüGfiüFéäiFacceleration and more final speed at the end of the table. The acceleration when I = MR2/2 is (2/3) g sing, so the disk will be moving faster at the bottom of the ramp and will travel farther. Examples of I-point answers: A disk has a larger rotational inertia, so it will have a greater kinetic energy and will therefore land farther from the ramp. The moment of inertia for the disk is smaller, thus its rotational velocity is bigger, causing it to go further. Less energy will be used to spin the disk than the hoop, and I of the disk is less than I of the hoop. " width="480" height="358" />

If the incorrect selection is made, no points are earned for the justification. For an indication that both blocks will have the same acceleration For a correct justification for why the net force is greater on the block of mass 3M Example: Because the blocks stick together, both blocks must have the same acceleration. Because the block of mass 3M has more mass, the net force on it must be greater than the net force on the block of mass 2M. " width="480" height="167" />
