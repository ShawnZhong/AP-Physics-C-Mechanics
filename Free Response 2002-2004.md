Question 3
----------

  <img src="./media/image388.png" alt="(c) Suppose that the object is released from rest at the origin. Determine the speed of the particle at x = 2 m. In the laboratory, you are given a glider of mass 0.5 kg on an air track. The glider is acted on by the force determined in part (b). Your goal is to determine experimentally the validity of your theoretical calculation in part (c). (d) From the list below, select the additional equipment you will need from the laboratory to do your experiment by checking the line next to each item. If you need more than one of an item, place the number you need on the line. Meterstick Balance Stopwatch Wood block Photo gate timer String Spring Set of objects of different masses (e) Briefly outline the procedure you will use, being explicit about what measurements you need to make in order to determine the speed. You may include a labeled diagram of your setup if it will clarify your procedure. "/>

Unreasonable indications, such as all the items being checked, were not awarded any points. (e) 3 points For a complete description of any correct procedure. Partial credit was awarded for less complete descriptions. The following were common examples. Other examples, though rarely cited, could receive partial or full credit. 1 Using photogates Place the photogates near x = 2 m and a small distance apart (such as a glider length). Measure the distance between the photogates. Measure the time the glider takes to travel between the photogates. Obtain the speed from distance/time. time to travel 2 m was used. 2. Using a spring The spring constant k of the spring must be known, or if not, then measured. Set up the spring at x = 2 m so that it is compressed when struck by the glider. Measure the distance of maximum compression Xm. The velocity can then be determined from the equation = 3. Treating the glider as a projectile Adjust the starting point so that x = 2 m is at end of the track. Thus the glider leaves the track at this point and becomes a projectile. The height of the track determines the time interval t that the glider is in the air. The horizontal distance x from the end of the track to the point where the glider hits the ground is measured and then the velocity is computed from x/t. "/>
