Question 3
----------

  <img src="./media/image409.png" alt="Before Collision After Collision TOP VIEWS Mech. 3. A system consists of a ball of mass M2 and a uniform rod of mass Ml and length d. The rod is attached to a horizontal frictionless table by a pivot at point P and initially rotates at an angular speed o , as shown above left. The rotational inertia of the rod about point P is —Mld2. The rod strikes the ball, which is initially at rest. As a result of this collision, the rod is stopped and the ball moves in the direction shown above right. Express all answers in terms of Ml , M2, (D , d, and fundamental constants. "/>

Question 3
----------

  <img src="./media/image416.png" alt="Mech 3. A thin hoop of mass M, radius R, and rotational inertia MR2 is released from rest from the top of the ramp of length L above. The ramp makes an angle 9 with respect to a horizontal tabletop to which the ramp is fixed. The table is a height H above the floor. Assume that the hoop rolls without slipping down the ramp and across the table. Express all algebraic answers in terms of given quantities and fundamental constants. (a) Derive an expression for the acceleration of the center of mass of the hoop as it rolls down the ramp. "/>

  <img src="./media/image417.png" alt="(a) 5 points For use of Newton&#39;s 2nd law in rotational form and the parallel axis theorem ET = lacm and 1 = + Mh2 For a correct rotational inertia about the point of contact using the parallel axis theorem 1 = MR2 + MR2 = 2MR2 For a correct to ue about the point of contact = RMgsin9 For a correct relationship between linear and angular acceleration for rolling without slipping a a Substituting for ET , I, and acm into the rotational equation above RMgsin9 = 2MR2 acm For the correct answer a = —sin9 2 "/>

  <img src="./media/image418.png" alt="(d) Suppose that the hoop is now replaced by a disk having the same mass M and radius R. How will the distance from the edge of the table to where the disk lands on the floor compare with the distance determined in part (c) for the hoop? Less than The same as Greater than Briefly justify your response. "/>

  <img src="./media/image419.png" alt="(d) 3 points For checking the space next to &quot;Greater than&quot; For a sufficiently detailed justification containing no incorrect statements. Such an answer logically concludes, at a minimum, that the linear speed or velocity at the bottom of the ramp is greater for the disk because the rotational inertia of the disk is less. It is not necessary to state that the time of fall is the same. One point was awarded for a minimal or partially correct answer. No justification points were awarded if the space next to &quot;Greater than &quot; was not checked. Examples of 2-point answers: A disk will have smaller rotational inertia and will therefore have velocity. This will lead to a greater translational velocity, and a greater distance x. The rotational inertia is less thanüfiÖfi6ÖTüGfiüFéäiFacceleration and more final speed at the end of the table. The acceleration when I = MR2/2 is (2/3) g sing, so the disk will be moving faster at the bottom of the ramp and will travel farther. Examples of I-point answers: A disk has a larger rotational inertia, so it will have a greater kinetic energy and will therefore land farther from the ramp. The moment of inertia for the disk is smaller, thus its rotational velocity is bigger, causing it to go further. Less energy will be used to spin the disk than the hoop, and I of the disk is less than I of the hoop. "/>
